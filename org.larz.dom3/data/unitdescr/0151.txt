<p>The Witches of Avalon begin their careers as Daughters dressed in white. They are sent to serve the Coven in war and peace. As a Daughter gains knowledge and responsibility, she is given three tests and when she passes them, she becomes a Mother. The Witches of Avalon are skilled in the magic of Nature and can use Spellsongs once sung by the Sidhe of Tir na n'Og. The older Witches also use Air magic and some Crones are skilled in other paths of magic as well.</p>
