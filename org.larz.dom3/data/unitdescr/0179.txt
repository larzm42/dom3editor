<p>A Lich is the dried husk of a mage adept in Death magic. Through dark rituals, the mage succeeded in mastering one of mankind's oldest and most urgent goals: to defeat death. By removing his viscera and hiding it outside his body, the Lich is virtually impossible to slay. Should the body be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of dead humans. Being immortal, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood. The Lich lacks the Arch Mage's broad base of magical knowledge, but the reanimated body of the Lich is more durable than a living body since it is leathery and dry and lacks all organs of importance.</p>
