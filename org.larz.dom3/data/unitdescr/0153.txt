<p>The Crones of Avalon are the oldest and most powerful Witches of Avalon. Secluded in the Tower of Avalon, they avoid the bickering of lowly lords, but will aid the kingdom and its Master in times of dire need. The Witches of Avalon are skilled in the magic of Nature and can use spellsongs once sung by the Sidhe of Tir na n'Og. The older Witches also use Air magic and some Crones are skilled in other paths of magic as well.</p>
