<p>The Norns are strange, cowled hags of unknown origin. They divine and weave the fates of men and are said to decide even the fates of gods in their weaving. They aid the Jarls of Jotun simply because the Jarls are descendants of the ancient godlike giants known as the Rimtursar. Norns are seeresses of great power and can prevent one out of six bad events before they occur.</p>
