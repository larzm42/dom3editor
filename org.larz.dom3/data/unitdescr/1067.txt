<p>Mermen are amphibious beings related to tritons, but have fish tails instead of legs. Mermen have strange powers of transformation and can remove their tails to walk on dry land. They live in shallow waters along the coastlines and sometimes build villages on land. Wave Warriors and Wave Lords are given bronze armor by their masters.</p>
