<p>In the misty swamps of Pythia lies one of the entrances to the underworld. Here is placed a beast of might and malice unequalled. She is the daughter of Typhon, Enemy of Gods, and Echidna, Mother of Monsters, and her name is Hydra. Gifted with unparallelled regenerative powers and poisonous breath, she eternally guards the entrance to the underworld. Like her lesser kin, she has nine heads. However, her central head is blessed by her father and is immortal. Should it be cut a new body will regrow from the stump within weeks. Hydra is sacred and can be summoned by the serpent priests of Pythium.</p>
