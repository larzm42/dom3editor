<p>The Partholonians were once the rulers of the Sauromatian lands, but have long since vanished. Their sacred bones lie buried in tombs in the Sauromation swamps. In the mists of the marshland lies the castle of Delgnat. Here the longdead kin of the last Partholonian walks the halls and feasts on pomegranates of the dead, reanimated by the dark sorcery of Delgnat in her vain attempts to escape solitude. Ancient bones in ancient armor are forced to masquerade as the living to appease their lady. The Partholonian dead are still wreathed in illusions, their bones sacred and their weapons ensorcelled, crafted as they were when the Partholonians still walked the land ages ago.</p>
