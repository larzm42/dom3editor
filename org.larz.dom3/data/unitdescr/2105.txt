<p>The Ryujin are the sons of the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea. From the palace of four seasons, they have spread the dominion of the dragon king and set up courts in the image of Ryugo-jo, the dragon court. The Ryujin have sinous bodies and are covered in scales. Spines run along their backs and their heads resemble camels with horns of a stag and the eyes of a demon. They always carry with them a burning pearl that is the source of their powers. Ryujin are powerful mages of water and the elements and are considered sacred by the populace of Jomon.</p>
