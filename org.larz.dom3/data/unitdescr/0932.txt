<p>Ancient trees are sometimes inhabited by spirits that can manifest themselves as beautiful women. These spirits are known as hamadryads. Hamadryads are stunningly beautiful and few mortals would willingly harm them. Hamadryads are ethereal and regenerate wounds as long as their tree is not destroyed. They never leave the province they are summoned to.</p>
