<p>The tatsu is a lesser jomonese dragon. It has a sinous body and resembles the great Dragons of the sea, but it only has three claws on its feet. It is covered in irridescent scales and spines run along its back. Its head resemble a camel with horns of a stag and the eyes of a demon. Under its chin is a burning pearl that is the source of its power. If they lose the pearl they lose their power of flight. All tatsu have magic skills and each follow one of the Five Paths.</p>
