<p>This is one of two spears made for the sons of a king in ancient times. The spears give the wielder increased leadership and luck in battle. One spear was given powers of Death and the other was given powers over the Void. The first one reanimates those killed by its deadly point. The second spear allows the wielder to call Lesser Horrors in battle.</p>
