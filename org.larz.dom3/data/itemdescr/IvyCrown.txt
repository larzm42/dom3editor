<p>The Ivy Crown is a replica of the ivy crowns worn by exalted vinemen in ancient times before men came and drove them away. Vinemen perceive the wearer as an ancient Vine Lord and will gladly serve him. The crown is of great help when awakening vine creatures in the forests and will increase the effect of the Awaken Vine Men and Awaken Vine Ogre spells.</p>
