<p>This is a small and very fierce head that belongs to that most renonwed and admired of all Hoburg heroes, Holger the Headless Hoburg Hero. When this head is held and boldly presented to the enemy, Holger will come rushing from wherever he is stuffing his headless neck with prechewed food or filtered soup. Once the battle is joined, Holger will do his best to finish it quickly, so that he might once more return to his headless gluttony. Should Holger's body be slain, a new one will grow after a few days and start stuffing itself with food.</p>
