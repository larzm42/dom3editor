<p>This gruesome blade was designed by Vestur of the Black Coven. The dark powers of the sword consumed its maker when he first used it in battle. When he returned from beyond the grave, its powers were tamed.  The black blade is covered with runes of death and destruction, and was tempered in the essence of dying souls. Only the undead are safe from the destructive powers of the sword.</p>
