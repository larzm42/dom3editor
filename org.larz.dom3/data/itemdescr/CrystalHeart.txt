<p>The Crystal Heart is a heart-shaped crystal placed in the chest of its owner behind his ordinary heart. If the owner later dies, the crystal will release its energies and restore the owner to full health.  The crude surgery used when embedding the heart will most likely permanently damage its owner. Inanimate beings cannot use magic hearts.</p>
