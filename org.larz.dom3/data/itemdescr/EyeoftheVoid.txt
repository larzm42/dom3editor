<p>This eye, taken from a dead Void being, should be applied in the eye socket of a newly removed eye. By doing this, the patient will open a path to the Void into which he can see with his new eye. This will enable him to see the world as it really is and dispel all illusion and phantasms close to him very effectively. He will also be able to cast spells more effectively, but he will also be more vulnerable to enemy spells.</p>
