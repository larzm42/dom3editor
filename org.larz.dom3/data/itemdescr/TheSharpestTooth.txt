<p>This is the sharpest tooth from the most venomous Wyrm ever known to have lived. It is now empowered with runes both to amplify the venomousness of the tooth and to protect the wielder from the poison. There is no handle as such, but the base of the tooth is wrapped in angel skin to nullify the otherwise baneful effect on the wielder. It is so venomous that it will affect even poison-immune creatures.</p>
