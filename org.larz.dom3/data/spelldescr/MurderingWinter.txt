<p>A sudden, furious blizzard will strike an enemy army camp in a province of the mage's choice. The blizzard is very powerful and will kill most normal men unless they are located in a hot province. The spell will be extremely powerful if it is cast in a very cold province.  There is still a very high chance that part of the enemy army will not be in the army camp when the blizzard strikes.
