<p>The necromancer enchants the bodies of the dead and calls forth a horde of Longdead Warriors and Soulless. If there are no unburied dead on the battle field, only Longdead will be raised. There will be fewer unburied dead left in the province if the raised Soulless are destroyed during the battle. Skeletons and Soulless are undead and will fall apart if left on the battlefield without undead leadership.
