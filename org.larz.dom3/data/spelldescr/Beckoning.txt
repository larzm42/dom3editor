<p>The caster awakens the forces of the wild, which call out to lure the unwary. Those who fall prey vanish into the woodlands, never to be seen again. The Beckoning will only work in forests and forest beings are immune to the call. The Beckoning targets up to one third of the soldiers in a land, but those who are strong of mind or duty will resist the call. The maximum number of units affected by this spell depends on the level of the caster.
