<p>The caster seals a pact with Horrors. The Horrors create a dome that protects the province from most spells (75 percent protection) that originate from outside the warded province. Trying to cast a spell through this dome is very dangerous and might drive the casting mage insane. The pact has a downside too, which will become apparent to mages living under the dome. The creators of the dome will occasionally attack and consume a mage. The dome will dissolve instantly if its creator dies.
