<p>This mighty ritual is a blessing to units across the world. Diseases, old age, suffering and pains are all drained of some of their essence. All malign energies are siphoned from the world and concentrated in the Well of Misery, effectively giving the caster a huge income of magical gems of Death. Tax revenue is slightly increased in all countries in the world. The spell lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies.
