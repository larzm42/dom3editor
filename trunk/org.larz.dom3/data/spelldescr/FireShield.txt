<p>A wall of fire surrounds the mage. Anyone trying to strike the mage in melee combat will be burned by the Fire Shield first. Attackers with long weapons such as spears and pikes will not suffer as severe burns as an attacker with a dagger or fist. The power of the Fire Shield is determined by the mage's skill in Fire magic.
