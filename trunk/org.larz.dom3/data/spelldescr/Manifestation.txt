<p>With this spell, an Ashen Angel is summoned with the promise of an opportunity to kill a commander in this realm and to bring his soul back to the Lord of the Netherworld. The Ashen Angel will appear in a province of the mage's choice. There is a 50 percent chance that a commander is deemed suitable for the Ashen Angel. If no suitable commander is found, the Angel will return to the mage and kill him instead. A commander who is horror marked runs a greater risk of being chosen by the Angel.</p>
