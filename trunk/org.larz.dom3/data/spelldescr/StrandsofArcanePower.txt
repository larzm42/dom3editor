<p>This mighty enchantment enables the caster to project his mind to many distant places at once, via strands of arcane power. While projected, the caster will only be able to sense and affect magic, but this still makes it possible to search for magic sites and enemy mages. The caster will be able to project himself into all provinces that have a friendly Dominion.</p>
