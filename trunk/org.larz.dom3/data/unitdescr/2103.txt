<p>In the courts of the Dragon Kings strange half-men dwell. The Shark Warriors are the mightiest of these servants and they form the elite guard of the dragon courts. They have the body of a man with a sharklike head. Their skin is thick and tough like that of a shark. The Shark Warriors are normally armed with a yari and heavy armors. Shark Warriors have no problem leaving the sea, but they have not adopted dry land tactics and do not use bows.</p>
