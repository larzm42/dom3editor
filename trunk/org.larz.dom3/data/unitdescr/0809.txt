<p>Shadow Vestals are the result of a dark rite known as Shadow Merging. Young girls are trained in the Temple of the Dead to prepare them for the merging. When ready, a girl surrenders herself and is merged with the ghost of an ancient Vestal Virgin. The Shadow Vestal is an ethereal being, part living and part dead. Shadow Vestals are sacred and can be blessed.</p>
