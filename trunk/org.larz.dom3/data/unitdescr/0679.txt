<p>A wraith Consul is the spirit of an ancient Ermorian Consul that has been brought back from the Underworld to lead the spectral legions marching forth from the Soul Gates. Able commanders and powerful priests, the Consuls were influential Senators chosen to command the legions of Ermor. Wraiths are immortal and will return from the Land of the Dead if slain in battle.</p>
