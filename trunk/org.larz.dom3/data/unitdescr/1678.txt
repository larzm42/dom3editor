<p>Deepthought is an ancient Olm grown to huge proportions. It is rarely seen but well known among the Wet Ones of the Deeper Caverns. Its mind and might have grown with its body and it has been called upon several times to give advice to the Oracles on matters of the Deeper Waters. Deepthought is sacred to the Pale Ones of Agartha.</p>
