<p>The Eagle Kings are the last remaining Yazatas, or 'Adorable Ones'. The Yazatas were semi-divine beings of an earlier age and the ancestors of the Caelians. Their power was broken by the previous Pantokrator and most fled to the Celestial Sphere ages ago. The few remaining Yazatas hid beyond the clouds of the highest mountains and begot offspring known as Caelians. From their palace they rule their lesser kin and plan the reconquest of a world once theirs. Eagle Kings are surrounded by an Aura of Splendour that strikes mortals with awe. They have very long lifespans and are very powerful mages of winds and weather. They wear crowns and don enchanted golden armor.</p>
