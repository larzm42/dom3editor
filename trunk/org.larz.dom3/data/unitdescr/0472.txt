<p>The Sacred Statue is a powerful spirit inhabiting a huge statue. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and it is also magically powerful. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.</p>
