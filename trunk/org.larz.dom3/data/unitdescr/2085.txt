Rudely awakened she emerged from her milennial slumber, never to sleep again. Mother Hydra is now travelling from ruin to ruin gathering her flock and teaching them how to resist the urge to sleep. With the sudden arrival of the Atlantians of the forsaken coast her power and teaching has become instrumental in the conquest of the dream-ridden seas. Mother Hydra has slept for a thousand years.
