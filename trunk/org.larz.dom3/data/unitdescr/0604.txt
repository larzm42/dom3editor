<p>The Lord of the Night is a terrible being risen from the forests of Mictlan. It resembles a human with the wings and head of a bat. The Lord of the Night can call fiends of darkness to aid him in battle and he is skilled in both Blood and Death magic. The Lord of the Night is stealthy and can travel unseen under the night skies. Like all gods of the Mictlan pantheon, the beast craves blood and his Dominion will diminish unless he is sated with human sacrifices.</p>
