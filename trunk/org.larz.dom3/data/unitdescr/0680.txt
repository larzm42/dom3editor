<p>A wraith Senator is the spirit of an ancient Ermorian Senator that has been brought back from the Underworld to lead the spirits emerging from the Soul Gates. The Senatorial class served as the political and religious leaders of Ermor and they rarely led armies. Wraiths are immortal and will return from the Land of the Dead if slain in battle.</p>
