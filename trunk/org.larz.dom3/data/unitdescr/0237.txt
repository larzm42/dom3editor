<p>Dryads are female satyrs. They are similar in appearance to male satyrs but have white fur on their hindquarters. Dryads are blessed with aphrodisiac beauty and male humans find it very difficult to strike them down even in the heat of battle. Dryads are priestesses of the Sacred Groves and are revered by all the wild beings of Pangaea.</p>
