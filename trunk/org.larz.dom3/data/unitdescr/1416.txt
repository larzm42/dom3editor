<p>Mermen are amphibious beings related to tritons, but have fish tails instead of legs. Mermen have strange powers of transformation and can remove their tails to walk on dry land. They live in shallow waters along the coastlines and sometimes build villages on land. Mermages are skilled in Water magic and sometimes learn other magic paths as well. Mermages lose some of their skills in Water magic when they leave the sea.</p>
