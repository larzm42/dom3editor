<p>A demilich is the dried husk of a mage adept in Death magic that has been subjected to the Lichcraft ritual. By removing the viscera and hiding it outside the body of the demilich, the caster can ensure the immortality and loyalty of the demilich. Should the body of the demilich be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of dead humans.</p>
